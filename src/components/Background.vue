    <h1>Background</h1>

    <h2>Pre-academia</h2>
    <p>In high school I thought I hated math. I don't blame my math teachers, I blame the curriculum and the current educational systems, and I blame myself a little because I was an odd kid found my way back to math and science eventually through a path that wouldn't have worked for everyone. So I ended up going into college thinking I'd end up doing some Englishy thing...</p>

    <h3>Undergrad</h3>
    <p>But, I ended up majoring in cognitive science and philosophy, both being heavily balanced towards language and logic. </p>

    <p>I also have an area certificate in philosophy of science.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Grad school</h3>
    <p>My master's is in logic. This mostly is theoretical computer science and mathematics.</p>

    <h3>Post-academia</h3>
