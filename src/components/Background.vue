    <h1>Background</h1>

    <h2>Pre-academia</h2>
    <p>In high school I thought I hated math. I don't blame my math teachers, I blame the curriculum and the current educational systems, and I blame myself a little because I was an odd kid found my way back to math and science eventually through a path that wouldn't have worked for everyone. So I ended up going into college thinking I'd end up doing some Englishy thing...</p>

    <h2>Undergrad</h2>
    <p>But, I ended up majoring in cognitive science and philosophy, both being heavily balanced towards language and logic. I guess that doesn't sound so far from liberal arts, especially since this was a BA as opposed to a BS, but I found out I really, really liked math and the theoretical stuff after all. Really it took logic to bring me back to mathematics. One summer I took an intro to symbolic logic and that kind of cemented it for me.</p>

    <p>I also have an area certificate in philosophy of science.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Grad school</h2>
    <p>My master's is in logic. This mostly was theoretical computer science and mathematics, although the program was pretty interdisciplinary. There were students that showed up for the orientation that ended up studying philosophy that I didn't see again because those classes were all at a different campus.</p>

    <p>I convered a lot of ground in this program: lambda calculus, proof theory, cryptography, information theory, Kolmogorov complexity, quantum computing, and of course logic. This was capped off by my thesis on parsing programming languages written with the help of my advisor Bruno Loff.</p>

    <h2>Post-academia</h2>

    <p>In 2019 I decided to take on a new direction. I applied for two bootcamps: one in JavaScript/web development and one in data science. This took me to the end of March 2020, right when COVID hit the US. At that point, I actually started teaching JavaScript (remotely so far) at Eleven Fifty, the bootcamp where I myself learned the year before.</p>

    <p>In my free time these days I'm trying to pick up the Dutch I never learned when I was actually in the Netherlands.</p>
